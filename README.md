# Jsonoo

JSON library for Js_of_ocaml

This library provides a very similar API to the excellent BuckleScript library,
[bs-json](https://github.com/glennsl/bs-json) by
[glennsl](https://github.com/glennsl), which is licensed under
[LGPL v3](https://github.com/glennsl/bs-json/blob/master/LICENSE.LGPL-3.0) or
[MPL](https://github.com/glennsl/bs-json/blob/master/LICENSE.MPL-2.0). Unlike
bs-json, this port of the library tries to follow OCaml naming conventions and
be easier to interface with other OCaml types like `Hashtbl.t`. This library
passes a nearly equivalent test suite.
